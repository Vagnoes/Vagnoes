        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Here is a brief summary of my academic journey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Program:</strong> +1 Commerce</li>
            <li><strong>Future Aspiration:</strong> Chartered Accountant (CA)</li>
            <li>I have successfully completed several crucial courses in web development that have laid the foundation for my skills in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. These courses have equipped me with a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, including:

                HTML & CSS: Mastering the basics of web structure and design.
                JavaScript & jQuery: Enhancing interactivity and dynamic features on websites.
                Responsive Web Design: Ensuring websites function seamlessly across devices.
                Back-End Development: Using modern frameworks and languages to build scalable web applications.
                Databases & API Integration: Understanding how to manage and exchange data for a better user experience.
                These skills have enabled me to take on challenging projects, from building e-commerce sites to custom web applications, all while maintaining an emphasis on usability, aesthetics, and functionality.
                
                Future Aspiration
                
                Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to become a Chartered Accountant (CA). While I am passionate about web development, I also recognize the importance of financial knowledge and expertise in shaping my professional growth. I am dedicated to advancing my education in commerce and accounting, with a focus on becoming a CA.
                
                With a strong foundation in both tech and finance, I hope to leverage my skills in the future to bridge the gap between technology and finance, creating innovative solutions for businesses and individuals alike.</li>
