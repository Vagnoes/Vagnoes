        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Hisham, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a keen eye for design and functionality. I specialize in creating dynamic, user-friendly, and visually stunning websites that help individuals and businesses establish a strong online presence.

            With a deep understanding of front-end and back-end development, I enjoy transforming ideas into fully functional digital experiences. My skill set includes:
            
            Front-End Development: Crafting responsive, visually appealing interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Back-End Development: Building robust, secure, and scalable solutions using modern technologies.
            Creative Problem Solving: Finding innovative ways to bring unique ideas to life online.
            Beyond coding, I have a passion for learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. Whether it’s designing a portfolio, developing an e-commerce site, or building a custom web application, I thrive on delivering exceptional results tailored to my clients' needs.
            
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new design inspirations, experimenting with photography, or honing my calligraphy skills.
            
            Let’s work together to turn your vision into a reality!.</p>
